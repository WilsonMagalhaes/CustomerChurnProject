# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project was developed solely for educational purposes to practice data science skills and is **not intended for commercial use**. Please refrain from using it for any other objectives.

## Project Overview

The web application for this customer churn prediction project can be accessed [here](https://customerchurnproject-yuwdcrd38pqpmv4rkprnsa.streamlit.app/).

The app predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn based on various features. Users can input customer data manually or upload a CSV file to generate predictions.

## Running the Streamlit App Locally

If you'd like to run the app locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. To launch the Streamlit app, you'll need an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) authtoken to allow public access to your local server. 
   
   - Create an account on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) if you don't have one.
   - Retrieve your authtoken from your ngrok dashboard.
   - In the notebook `RunStreamlitApp.ipynb`, replace `your_authtoken_here` with your ngrok authtoken.
   
4. Run the notebook to start the Streamlit app locally.
