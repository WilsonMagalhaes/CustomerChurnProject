Deployment:

The project is deployed on Streamlit Cloud, enabling users to interact with the customer churn prediction model via a web interface. Users have two options for predictions:

1 - Individual Predictions: Input individual customer details to receive real-time predictions.
2 - Batch Predictions: Upload a CSV file with multiple customers' data to generate predictions for all entries at once.

After the predictions are made, the app allows users to download the updated CSV file with an additional column, "Prediction", containing the results.
