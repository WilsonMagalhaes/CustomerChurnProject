Model Selection & Tuning:
- Resampling: To address class imbalance, SMOTEENN() was used on the training data to balance the classes.
- Model Testing: The following models were tested:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - AdaBoost
  - XGBoost
  - Naive Bayes
- Grid Search: GridSearchCV was used to optimize hyperparameters for each model.
- Feature Selection: SelectKBest was applied to select the most important features.
- Class Balancing: Applied class_weight='balanced' for some models.
