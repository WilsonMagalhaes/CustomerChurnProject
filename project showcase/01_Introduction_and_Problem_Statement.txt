Customer Churn Prediction for Telco Company
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. 
The goal is to identify which customers are likely to stop using the service, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them. 
This project was implemented as part of my data science portfolio to demonstrate my ability to handle end-to-end machine learning workflows, 
from data preprocessing to model deployment. 
The final model has been deployed using Streamlit Cloud, where users can input customer information to predict churn or upload CSV files for batch predictions.
