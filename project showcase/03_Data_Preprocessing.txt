Data Preprocessing:
- Encoding: Applied OneHotEncoder for categorical variables with more than two options and OrdinalEncoder for those with only two options (typically "Yes" and "No").
- Scaling: Used StandardScaler to scale numerical features.
- Missing Values: Although the original dataset had no missing values, SimpleImputer(strategy='median') was applied to numeric features and SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent') to categorical features in the pipeline to handle potential missing values after encoding.
- Feature Engineering:
  - Dropped the customerID column as it doesn't provide predictive value.
  - Converted the TotalCharges column to numeric (initially read as categorical).
  - Created a new feature Tenure_MonthlyCharges by multiplying tenure by MonthlyCharges.
- Target Variable: Encoded the Churn column using OrdinalEncoder.
